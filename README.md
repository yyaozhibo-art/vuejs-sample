# Docker Vue.js Sample Project

This project demonstrates how to effectively containerize a modern Vue.js application using Docker for both **development** and **production** workflows.

It is used as part of the [official Docker Vue.js sample guide](https://docs.docker.com/guides/vuejs/), showcasing industry best practices for front-end containerization—including secure builds, streamlined development workflows, and optimized production delivery.
